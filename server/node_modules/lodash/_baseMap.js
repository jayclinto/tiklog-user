     * @property {number} buffer - A minimum threshold buffer in order to say that
     * the `queue` is `unsaturated`.
     * @property {Function} empty - a function that sets a callback that is called

     * is omitted, `q.empty()` returns a promise for the next occurrence.
     * @property {Function} drain - a function that sets a callback that is called
     * when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`. If the
     * callback is omitted, `q.drain()` returns a promise for the next occurrence.
